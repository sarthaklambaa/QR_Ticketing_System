# QR Ticketing System

Welcome to the QR Ticketing System repository! This project is a minimal yet effective solution for generating and managing electronic tickets using Python, HTML, CSS, and SQLite3. The system allows users to input their information, generates a unique ticket ID, and provides a downloadable PDF containing a QR code for easy verification.

## Features

- **User Information Input:** Collects user's name, date of birth, and phone number for ticket generation.
- **Unique Ticket ID:** Generates a unique ticket ID for each user.
- **QR Code Generation:** Creates a QR code for each booking, facilitating quick and secure access to events and venues.
- **PDF Download:** Allows users to download a PDF containing the QR code for their ticket.
- **Slot Booking (Future Enhancement):** The system supports slot booking for specific time slots, enabling personal usage for events with limited seating or for booking appointments.
